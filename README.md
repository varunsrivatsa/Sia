## üëã Introduction

**Sia** is an **open-source personal assistant** who can live **on your server or local system**.

She **does stuff** when you **ask her for**.

You can **talk to her** and she can **talk to you**.
You can also **text her** and she can also **text you**.
If you want to, Sia can communicate with you by being **offline to protect your privacy**.

### Azure technologies used

> 1. **Azure text-to-speech** : With the help of text-to-speech feature of the Speech service, which is part of Azure Cognitive Services. Sia is able to interact with us by converting text into humanlike synthesized speech.
>
>    With the help of nodejs npm package : `npm i microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk`.We can synthesize speech using text or string to a .wav file in the location that we specified.
>
>    The text-to-speech feature in the Azure Speech service supports more than 270 voices and more than 110 languages and variants.
>
>    Currently, Sia is using `en-US-AmberNeural` voice.
>
> 2. **Azure speech-to-text** : _(Not yet integrated, still under development)_

Azure text-to-speech ( Azure tts ). üëá

```js
import * as sdk from "microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk";
import { SpeechSynthesizer } from "microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk";
import Ffmpeg from "fluent-ffmpeg";
import { path as ffmpegPath } from "@ffmpeg-installer/ffmpeg";
import { path as ffprobePath } from "@ffprobe-installer/ffprobe";
import fs from "fs";

import log from "../../helpers/log.js";
import string from "../../helpers/string.js";

log.title("Azure TTS Synthesizer");

const synthesizer = {};
const voices = {
  "en-US": {
    voice: "en-US-AmberNeural",
  },
};
let client = {};
const file = `${__dirname}/../../tmp/${Date.now()}-${string.random(4)}.wav`;

/**
 * Initialize Azure Text-to-Speech based on credentials in the JSON file
 */

synthesizer.init = () => {
  const config = JSON.parse(
    fs.readFileSync(`${__dirname}/../../config/voice/azure-tts.json`, "utf8")
  );
  const speechConfig = sdk.SpeechConfig.fromSubscription(
    config.key,
    config.region
  );
  const audioConfig = sdk.AudioConfig.fromAudioFileOutput(file);
  speechConfig.speechSynthesisLanguage = "en-US";
  speechConfig.speechSynthesisVoiceName = voices[process.env.SIA_LANG].voice;
  try {
    client = new SpeechSynthesizer(speechConfig, audioConfig);
    log.success("Synthesizer initialized");
  } catch (e) {
    log.error(`Azure TTS: ${e}`);
  }
};

/**
 * Save string to audio file
 */

synthesizer.save = (speech, em, cb) => {
  client.speakTextAsync(speech, ({ result }) => {
    const wStream = fs.createWriteStream(file);

    result.pipe(wStream);

    wStream.on("finish", () => {
      const ffmpeg = new Ffmpeg();
      ffmpeg.setFfmpegPath(ffmpegPath);
      ffmpeg.setFfprobePath(ffprobePath);

      // Get file duration thanks to ffprobe
      ffmpeg.input(file).ffprobe((err, data) => {
        if (err) log.error(err);
        else {
          const duration = data.streams[0].duration * 1000;
          em.emit("saved", duration);
          cb(file, duration);
        }
      });
    });

    wStream.on("error", (err) => {
      log.error(`Azure TTS: ${err}`);
    });
  });
};

export default synthesizer;
```

### Why?

> 1. If you are a developer (or not), you may want to build many things that could help in your daily life.
>    Instead of building a dedicated project for each of those ideas, Sia can help you with his
>    packages/modules (skills) structure.
> 2. With this generic structure, everyone can create their own modules and share them with others.
>    Therefore there is only one core (to rule them all).
> 3. Sia uses AI concepts, which is cool.
> 4. Privacy matters, you can configure Sia to talk with her offline. You can already text with her without any third party services.
> 5. Open source is great.

### What is this repository for?

> This repository contains the following nodes of Sia:
>
> - The server
> - The packages/modules
> - The web app
> - The hotword node

### What is Sia able to do?

> Today, the most interesting part is about her core and the way she can scale up. She is pretty young but can easily scale to have new features (packages/modules).

Sounds cool right?

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 16
- [npm](https://npmjs.com/) >= 8
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) >= 3
- [Pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org) >= 2020.11.15
- Supported OSes: Linux, macOS and Windows

### Installation

```sh
# Clone the repository (stable branch)
git clone -b master https://github.com/varunsrivatsa/Sia.git sia


# Go to the project root
cd sia

# Install
npm install
```

### Usage

```sh
# Check the setup went well
npm run check

# Build
npm run build

# Run
npm start

# Go to http://localhost:1337
# Hooray! Sia is running
```

**Sia needs open source to live**, the more modules she has, the more skillful she becomes.
